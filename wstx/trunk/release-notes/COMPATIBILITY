== Changes from 2.0.x to 3.0.x ==

=== Stream reader ===

* Default setting for P_REPORT_PROLOG_WHITESPACE is
  now Boolean.TRUE (instead of Boolean.FALSE), to mimic behaviour
  of the StAX reference implementation, and to keep output in pass-through
  configurations more similar to input.

=== Event reader ===

* Event readers are now constructed so that P_LAZY_PARSING is always
  disabled (to get accurate XMLStreamExceptions instead of possible
  runtime exceptions, with no performance difference).
  Also, P_MIN_TEXT_SEGMENT will be set to maximum value, to avoid
  ever splitting a CHARACTERS or CDATA segment (to minimize number
  of event objects).
