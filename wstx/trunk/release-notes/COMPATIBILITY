== Changes from 2.0.x to 3.0.x ==

=== Stream reader ===

* Default setting for P_REPORT_PROLOG_WHITESPACE is
  now Boolean.TRUE (instead of Boolean.FALSE), to emulate behaviour
  of the StAX reference implementation, and to keep output in pass-through
  configurations more similar to input.
* Handling of undeclared entities changed so that no exception is thrown
  in non-expanding mode; this is similar to the way ref. impl. works.
* isCharacters() now only returns true if current event is CHARACTERS,
  instead of CHARACTERS, CDATA and SPACE (as in 1.0 and 2.0). Change was
  done for interoperatibility -- the StAX reference implementation
  behaves like 3.0.
* Removed property P_TEXT_BUFFER_LENGTH, since there is no real benefit
  from changing this setting -- text buffer is resized dynamically as
  needed, and initial value is largely irrelevant.

=== Event reader ===

* Event readers are now constructed so that P_LAZY_PARSING is always
  disabled (to get accurate XMLStreamExceptions instead of possible
  runtime exceptions, with no performance difference).
  Also, P_MIN_TEXT_SEGMENT will be set to maximum value, to avoid
  ever splitting a CHARACTERS or CDATA segment (to minimize number
  of event objects).
