Version: 3.0

Current version is very close to complete XML 1.0 compliance; and also
mostly XML 1.1 compliant.

Known issues regarding strict XML-conformance checking are:

XML 1.0:

* Validity checking for DTD element content groups wrt. PE expansion
  nesting is not complete.

XML 1.1:

* New linefeeds are not recognized as such
* Checking for high-range control characters (0x80 - 0x9F, 0x7F) is
  not done for all input sources.
