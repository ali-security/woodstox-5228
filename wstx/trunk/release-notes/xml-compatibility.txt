Version: 3.0

Current version is very close to complete XML 1.0 compliance; and also
mostly XML 1.1 compliant.

Known issues regarding strict XML-conformance checking are:

XML:

* Checking in 'standalone="yes"' mode, for externally declared entities
  is not done.
* Whether undeclared PEs are considered WFC or VC violation -- currently
  they are all WFC, but this is apparently not always the case (esp.
  for 'standalone="yes"' case)

XML 1.0:

* Validity checking for DTD element content groups wrt. PE expansion
  nesting is not complete.

XML 1.1:

* Handling of LSEP (0x2028) is only partially correct -- combinations with
  other linefeed characters are not 100% compliant
* Checking for high-range control characters (0x80 - 0x9F, 0x7F) is
  not done for all input sources; specifically 0x7F is problematic.
