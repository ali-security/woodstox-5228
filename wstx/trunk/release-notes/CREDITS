Here are people who have contributed to Woodstox development:
(version numbers indicate release in which the problem was fixed)

Tatu Saloranta, tatu.saloranta@iki.fi: Author

Christian Niles <christian@unit12.net>:
  * Pointed out the improvement to wstx.jar, that will set system properties
    necessary to automatically make Woodstox the default StAX implementation
    to use [v 0.8.3]

James Fogarty:
  * Found 3 bugs (getElementText() not working, incorrect index offset
    for non-ns getAttributeLocalName(), index-out-of-bounds when there
    were lots of attribute names whose hashes collide)
    [1.0-RC1, 1.0-RC2]

James Strachan:
  * Found problems with stream writer; namespace repairing mode was not
    working as expected
    [1.0-RC5]

Stepan Koltsov:
  * Found problems with event reader: was setting peeked event to null, yet
    trying to de-reference it
    [1.0-RC7]

Mat Gessel:
  * Pointed out a problem with XMLStreamReader.nextTag() implementation;
    was not skipping comments and PIs
    [1.0-final]

Dan Diephouse:
  * Reported problems with QName construction (null prefix causes
    exception on some QName implementations)
    [1.0.1]

Sven Köhler:
  * Reported the problem with blocking input streams, and behaviour of
    the UTF8 decoder Woodstox uses: this could cause "too early" blocking
    of readers, in cases where event(s) could be returned before needing
    to read more from underlying input stream.
    [1.0.4, 1.7]
  * Reported a bug in stream writer; a call to writeEmptyElement() followed
    by a call to writeEndElement() ignored latter call.
    [1.0.5, 1.9]

Casey Bowman:
  * Pointed out the (potential) problem with javax.xml.stream.Location;
    return values are ints, and may thus overflow for BIG documents.
    StAX2 extensions (XMLStreamLocation2) added to properly deal with
    the problem.
    [1.8, ...]

Stefan Wachter:
  * Reported a problem with handling of large documents; was sometimes
    throwing an ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception (mostly when dealing
    with gzipped streams).
    [1.0.3/1.8.1]

Eric Jain:
  * Reported a bug in default namespace handling; was reporting a bogus
    problem when declaring an explicit namespace before the default one
    on a start element
    [1.0.3/1.8.1]
  * Re-reported the problem with UTF-8 streams and array bounds (originally
    reported by Stefan Wachter), and provided unit test to reproduce it.
    [1.0.3/1.8.1]
