* Exception-handling:
   * Add a WstxOutputException?
   * Separate exception class for DTD-parsing problems?

* DTD-handling/parsing:
   * Parse less information if no validation needed: partially done, does not
     really create content specifications; could also ignore creation of
     attribute lists?
   * Verify that an unparsed entity refers to a declared notation.
   * Make public API that allows parsing of DTDs; main use will be
     to feed such DTD objects back as either override-DTDs (input),
     or actual DTDs (output+indenting, output+validation)

* Attribute validation:
   * Notation (enumerated) attrs:
      * Declaration checks:
          * All enumeration notations have to have been declared, prior
            to entountering ATTLIST declaration (on either subset)
* Caching:
   * Refactor caching out of input factory, to be shared between
     factories and input/output modes (but have 2 actual Maps in
     CacheManager, to prevent trashing by either side).

* Fragment parsing/writing:
   * Allow for reading and writing of XML document fragments; essentially
     suppressing checks for single-root, and assuming that the outermost
     element(s) are not document root nodes (meaning also that DTD is not
     allowed to be output)

* Input factories:
   * Create URI-based factory methods for readers (XMLStreamReader2)

* Stream writers:
   * Validate names (local, full), when such validation enabled

* Event API:
   * Implement CFG_PRESERVE_LOCATION (value false); need to have default
     event allocator that shares a single Location object (start of the
     file)

Documentation:

Low-level parsing:

* Change parseEntityName() to make sure that the whole entity name as well
  as trailing semicolon are from the same input source, to prevent the
  possibility of "split" entity names (which are not legal in XML).

Unit testing:

* Implement at least simple basic StAX-tests for:
   * Event reader
   * Stream writer
   * Event writer

Namespace handling:

* (optional) Check that URIs that match 'xml' and 'xmlns' are not redefined?
  This is done by Xerces; not sure if namespace specs dictate this?
  [implement for 1.x?]

Refactoring:

* Continue working on J2ME subset; partial implementations do exist for
  both input and output factories, but should be able to squeeze out
  some more classes from subsets.
