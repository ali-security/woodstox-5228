------------------------------------
Planned stuff for 3.1 or 4.0
------------------------------------

* Bugs / incomplete handling:
  * More optimal check for "]]>" in content. Now over 99% reliable, but
    theoretically could miss if combination on input buffer boundary.
  * XMLTest failures:
    * UTF-16, checks for 0xFFFE, 0xFFFF (2 failures)
    * Names, surrogate pairing (4 failures)
    * xmlns pseudo-attributes, non-CDATA type (1 failure)
  * Reporting of SPACE in DTD-aware, non-validating mode

* Removing cruft:
  * Remove support for pre-JDK-1.4
  * Remove non-normalizing (attr, text) modes

* Stax compatibility:
  * Return "" instead of null for 'default' (or 'no') namespace (for 4.0)
  * Change default for 'report SPACE outside root element' to false, from
    true (basically revert to pre-3.0 state)
  * Minimize unchecked (lazy) exceptions, by deferring throwing of some
    exceptions (at least any problems in CHARACTERS segment which are
    easy)

* Indentation/Pretty-printing:
   * Using DTD
   * Heuristically

* Interoperability:
   * Implement DOMTarget

* XML validation:
   * Integrate Multi-Schema Validator's W3C Schema validator using its
     native interface (RNG already integrated)
   * How about DTD++? Data types should be reasonably easy...?
     Would also allow partial W3C Schema and RelaxNG implementations
     natively?

* XML standards:
  * Xml:id support (is there need to disable it?)
  * XInclude
  * XML Catalog support

* Documentation:
   * Impl. details, like: always interns names, preserves attribute value
     orders.
   * Requirements for compiling, running:
      * Ant 1.5? (rootfileset)
      * Jars: for 1.3/1.2 SAX and DOM API jars?
      * How to build for 1.2, 1.3?
   * FAQ:
      * Output streaming; use of 'writeCharacters("");', flush()
