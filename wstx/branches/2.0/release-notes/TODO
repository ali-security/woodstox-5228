This file lists things that I would like to work on for next releases;
from bugs to new features.


== Unit Testing ==


== XML specs conformance ==

* Full text character validation (XML 1.1)?
   * Reader side:
      * For textual content (and comments, PIs)
   * Writer side:
      [DONE] * Names
      * Text/comment/PI content
* Support for XML 1.1 white space validation/normalization?
* Consider adding support for xml:base attribute?
* Should there be special handling for xml:space attribute?

== DTD-handling ==

* Implement catalog handling to allow using public ids and
  overriding/redirecting system id references?
* Try to verify entity nesting: entity values should not contain improperly
  nested elements, as per XML specs.
* DTD++?
* Optional output validation against DTD (might be pretty useful)
* Using external validator? (JARV)


== Missing/unused StAX features ==

== Stream writer issues ==

== Optimizing ==

* Try to keep track of white space status, in "fast" parsing (ie. if no
  copying is needed)? Will be more important when doing DTD-based normalization
  of attributes, marking if ignorable white space and so forth.
* (for 2.0 or 3.0): try to eliminate separate conversion to char, then
  parsing; would speed up common cases of UTF-8 and ISO-Latin? Would
  require demoting much of parsing to scanner/reader level, duplicating
  some functionality (one implementation per encoding). Wonder if it'd
  be worth it?


== Compatibility ==

* Implement missing JAXP Sources (SAXSource, DOMSource); now only uses
  StreamSources?
* Implement missing JAXP Targets (SAXTarget, DOMTarget); now only uses
  StreamSources?
* Maybe implement SAX interface; although wrappers exist, they currently
  may not be able to pass DTD information. There's also potential performance
  gain from doing it straight from Woodstox.


== Convenience ==

* Optional pretty-printing with writers, configurable indentation.

== Spin-offs ==

* Refactor to allow for excluding things that J2ME shouldn't need: possibly
  create "j2me-lite" and "j2me-normal"; former without any DTD handling?
