== Access to formerly missing information ==

* DOCTYPE declaration: can access root name, public/system identifiers,
  and internal subset all separately; similarly added matching
  output methods
* Attribute information: can find index of the specified attribute,
  as well as ID and NOTATION attribute indexes (as per DTD)
* Location information (XMLStreamLocation2):
   * Access to nested Locations (parent context)
   * Separate byte/char offsets; value type as long instead of
     int to allow for multi-gigabyte input [NOT FULLY IMPLEMENTED]
* Misc. information:
   * XMLStreamReader.isEmptyElement() (whether current
     START_ELEMENT was a result of an empty element, i.e. <tag />),
   * XMLStreamReader.getDepth() (number of enclosing start elements,
     including current START_ELEMENT)

== Efficient (fully streaming) access ==

* getText methods that write contents of textual events through
  Writer object passed as the argument
* Pass-through XMLStreamWriter.copyEventFromReader method
* XMLStreamReader.skipElement allows efficient skipping of all children
  of an element

== Configurable writers ==

* All events can now be output through specified XMLStreamWriter;
  this allows for full configuration of output (namespace bindings,
  encoding/quoting)
* Can define a custom quoter/encoder for textual content
* Can define a custom quoter/encoder for attribute values
* Raw write access using XMLStreamWriter.writeRaw(), for outputting
  text as is, without quoting/encoding.

== Basic support for per-reader/writer configuration ==

* XMLStreamReader: allow overriding of external DTD subset.
* XMLStreamWriter: (no options yet)
