------------------------------------
Planned stuff for 3.0 (or later)
------------------------------------

* Bugs / incomplete handling:
  * More optimal check for "]]>" in content. Now over 99% reliable, but
    theoretically could miss if combination on input buffer boundary.
  * XMLTest failures:
    * UTF-16, checks for 0xFFFE, 0xFFFF (2 failures)
    * Names, surrogate pairing (4 failures)
    * xmlns pseudo-attributes, non-CDATA type (1 failure)

* Interoperability:
   * Implement SAXSource, if possible?
   * Implement DOMTarget, and perhaps SAXTarget, if feasible.
[defer] * Native SAX(2?) wrappers? (this goal might not make sense -- basic
  wrapper exists, from Stax-utils, hard to cleanly implement natively)

* XML validation:
   * Integrate Multi-Schema Validator's W3C Schema validator using its
     native interface (RNG already integrated)
   * How about DTD++? Data types should be reasonably easy...?
     Would also allow partial W3C Schema and RelaxNG implementations
     natively?

* Indentation/Pretty-printing:
   * Using DTD
   * Heuristically

* Documentation:
   * Impl. details, like: always interns names, preserves attribute value
     orders.
   * Requirements for compiling, running:
      * Ant 1.5? (rootfileset)
      * Jars: for 1.3/1.2 SAX and DOM API jars?
      * How to build for 1.2, 1.3?
   * FAQ:
      * Output streaming; use of 'writeCharacters("");', flush()

* XML standards:
  * Xml:id support (is there need to disable it?)
  * XInclude
  * XML Catalog support
