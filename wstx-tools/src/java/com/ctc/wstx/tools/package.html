  <li>DTD flattener ({@link com.ctc.wstx.tools.DTDFlatten}) is a simple
command line utility that allows "flattening" of modular DTDs. It reads
in a file that contains main level file of an external DTD subset, resolves
recursively all of parameter entities, and outputs result into standard
output. Flattening is sometimes useful for performance reasons (only one
DTD file instead of dozens), or for debugging of complex DTDs.
