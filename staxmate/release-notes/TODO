* Writer side:
   * Buffer attributes properly; allow for resetting for buffered instances
   * Verify that buffered instances with "wrong" contexts are not added.
   * Add pass-through method to copy events from a XMLStreamReader or
     SMIterator?

* Reader side:
   * Methods for accessing attributes need to be added
