* Reader side:
   * Seriously investigate using XPath (Jaxen?)
   * Consider rewriting nesting, for example by making each cursor
     remember depth of its start tag, make context keep track of depth:
     this should simplify state tracking, make the system more robust.

* Writer side:
   * Buffer attributes properly; allow for resetting for buffered instances
   * Verify that buffered instances with "wrong" contexts are not added.
   * Add pass-through method to copy events from a XMLStreamReader or
     SMIterator?
